This script can help you to generate QA files for Supermemo iPhone easily.

About the database:
It extracts definitions from the New Oxford American Dictionary, so you need to buy this App first and get the "app.db" file from its ".ipa" file.

You can find the ".ipa" file from the "YOUR DOCUMENTS/iTunes/Mobile Applications" directory.

How to use:
1. Put all your words in a single text file. For example: words.txt.
2. Place SMGenerator.py, app.db, and your text file in the same direcotry.
3. Enter "python SMGenerator.py YOUR_FILE [OUTPUT_FILE_NAME]" in the console. YOUR_FILE is your file's name, and OUTPUT_FILE_NAME is the file that store all the output(optional).
4. Import the generated file in Supermemo iPhone through WiFi or http://www.supermemo.net. If you perfer the second way, you may register in that website first.

Have fun!
